    <h1>Welcome to the New You of the New Year!</h1>
    <p>
        Every new year is a milestone, filled with new beginnings for many individuals. 
        Setting new year resolutions means opening the doors to a year full of growth and change. 
        Write down your goals, and check them after 1 year; don't worry, we'll keep them safe for you, 
        and you can review them in the next year.
