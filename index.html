                Every new year is a milestone, filled with new beginnings for many individuals. 
                Setting new year resolutions means opening the doors to a year full of growth and change. 
                Write down your goals, and check them after 1 year; don't worry, we'll keep them safe for you, 
                and you can review them in the next year.
